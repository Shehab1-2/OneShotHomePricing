Home Price Estimation Algorithm
Welcome to the Home Price Estimation Algorithm! This project is all about making an easy-to-use, efficient tool for estimating home prices using a matrix-based approach in C programming.

Description

The core of this project is an algorithm implemented in C that utilizes matrix operations to estimate the prices of homes based on various inputs. This includes creating and manipulating matrices for linear regression, which is particularly useful for predicting housing prices based on historical data.

Features
Implements basic matrix operations like multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
Reads data from files to construct matrices representing housing features and prices.
Uses linear regression for price prediction.
Efficient memory management with dynamic allocation and deallocation.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this program, ensure you have a C compiler installed on your machine. GCC or Clang are recommended.

Installation
Clone the repo:
gcc -o home_price_estimator main.c
Usage
After compiling, run the program using:
./home_price_estimator data_file_1 data_file_2
Where data_file_1 and data_file_2 are the input files containing the housing data and features.
