# Home Price Estimation Algorithm

## Description

Welcome to the **Home Price Estimation Algorithm**! This project is all about developing an easy-to-use and efficient tool for estimating home prices using matrix operations in C.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Implements basic matrix functions such as multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
- **Linear Regression**: Utilizes linear regression for predicting housing prices based on historical data.
- **Efficient Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation and deallocation of matrices.
- **File Input/Output**: Reads housing data and features from files for processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler, like GCC or Clang, installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Home-Price-Estimation-Algorithm.git
2. **Compile the code**:
   ```bash
    gcc -o home_price_estimator main.c
3. **Run the Program using**:
   ```bash
    ./home_price_estimator data_file_1 data_file_2
  Replace data_file_1 and data_file_2 with your input file names.
